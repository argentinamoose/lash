# LASh
Luke's Awesome Shell, a unix shell written in rust.

## Why
I wanted to learn Rust and I thought it would be fun to write my own shell.

This is not intended as an alternative for the bash shell or any other shells out there. This project is very much lacking features that are present in most shells.

## Features
1. exit - exit the program
2. help - display a help message
3. echo <text> - print text to console
4. pwd - print the current directory
5. cd <directory> - change directories
6. ls - list current directory's contents
7. mkdir <name> - create a directory with the given name
8. touch <filename> - create a file with the given name
9. rm <filename> - delete a file
